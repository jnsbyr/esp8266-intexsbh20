## Motivation

Reading the user manual of the Intex PureSpa SB-H20 was a mistake. Everyone
who has ever read a user manual knows this. They just contain things you don't
want to know.

This model seems to be designed for daily attention. It is no news that the water
of a pool should be run through a filter once or twice a day. Many pools have a
timer for this, but not this one.

You could keep the circulation on permanently, but this has at least two
disadvantages: The filter must be cleaned or replaced more often and you waste
more than 1 kWh per day with the filter pump consuming around 60 W.

Somehow it should be possible to add a circulation pump timer. And if this can
be done then the water temperature could also be controlled, thus combining power
saving and comfort. Depending on the temperature profile you choose the energy
saving can be really significant compared to a constant temperature setting
because the heater consumes around 2 kW.


## Hacking the SB-H20

Opening the lid of the control panel and attaching a WiFi MCU in parallel to the
buttons was the first idea that came mind. This was possible with the predecessors
of this model, but not so with the control panel of the SB-H20. After testing around
the edges of the case with my pry tools it became obvious that the lid is probably
glued shut. If you want to open it anyway you might consider drilling holes into
the sides of the case first to get better leverage for prying but I did not want
to go that way.

Opening the pump unit and modifying the mainboard did not seem to be a good
alternative either. But there is a cable between the pump unit and the control
panel that might be tapped. Looking around I found the project
[diyscip](https://github.com/YorffoeG/diyscip) from Geoffroy Hubert that gave me
hope. Geoffroy did a splendid job with his reverse engineering but his project
is about the SSP and SJB whirlpool models.

Using a multimeter, a scope and a logic analyser helped to establish several
facts:

- there seems to be a good enough isolation between the mains and the signal lines
  (no guarantee whatsoever)
- the plug and the pinout of the SB-H20 control panel are identical to the SSP
  and SJB models
- most of the decoding of the signals from the mainboard to the control panel
  is identical or at least similar to the SSP and SJB models
- the original control panel and an additional remote control unit can be attached
  in parallel to the mainboard because the signalling supports a multi-drop
  architecture for listening
- the button signalling from the control panel to the mainboard seems to be
  completely different from Geoffroy's description

Getting all the details right for this last aspect took a while. With the SB-H20
data clock of 100 kHz it was like searching for a needle in a haystack. To get
20 data points per clock cycle you need to run the logic analyser with 2 MS/s
and this results in 4 million data points for the 2 seconds it takes to press
and release a button on the control panel. Programming an ESP8266 MCU to provide
a hardware trigger for the logic analyser was the key to narrow down where
the action takes place: the control panel pulls the data line low for about 2 Âµs
after a specific button scan data word was received from the mainboard and this
signalling must be repeated until the mainboard confirms the button action by
enabling the display beeper.

![Button Signalling](assets/Button-Signalling.png "SB-H20 button signalling: data is pulled low while enable is high")

Because of this difference between the Intex models it is not possible to use
Geoffroy's schematics and code for the SB-H20. After testing several variants
the required behaviour could be achieved with a much simpler circuit, that mostly
consists of an ESP8266 and a TTL level shifter for the 3 signals.

![Schematic](assets/Schematic.png "schematic of WiFi remote control for Intex SB-H20")

For the button signalling to work the ESP8266 must be running at 160 MHz to get
the timing right, but that is not all. Geoffroy documented in his code that the
interrupt driven data receive is unreliable but he did not name a reason. The
reason is that the ESP8266 WiFi processing has precedence over all other MCU
tasks and will disrupt time critical processing including ISRs. This is acceptable
for the data receive because the data repeats at a high frequency. Incomplete
frames can be ignored and invalid frame data can be filtered out by using only
repeated identical data. But during the button signalling a receive error causes
side effects. A single button press might be ignored or may cause a double change.
With multiple consecutive button presses the error probability increases
significantly. To prevent this I decided to activate the ESP8266 WiFi modem sleep
when changing the water temperature. This improves the reliability noticeably but
the ESP8266 looses its connection to the AP and the MQTT server for a few seconds.


## Building your own WiFi remote control

So far the SB-H20 was not modified. To keep it that way an Intex control panel
extension cable is needed to insert the WiFi remote control but I could not
find a source. If you have access to a 3D printer you should have a look at this
[3D model](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4130911). Otherwise you need to cut
and tap the cable from the control panel to the main board.

> :warning: **WARNING**: If you decide to continue you will void your warranty
  for the SB-H20. You may only **USE THIS PROJECT AT YOUR OWN RISK**.
  I do not provide any warranty and I will not assume any responsibility for any
  damage you cause yourself or others by using this project.

### PCB

Depending on your preferences you have several options available regarding the PCB:

- use a perfboard (the ciruit is rather simple)
- use the PCB design from @Elektroarzt
- create you own customized PCB

![Perfboard](assets/Perfboard.jpg "compact perfboard with sandwich connectors")

![PCB](pcb/PCB.jpeg "PCB with screw terminal")

It is not even essential to use the D1 mini, it just makes uploading the firmware
and the config file easier because you don't need an extra USB adapter and a 5 V DC
converter is also included. Any other ESP8266 board with enough ports on the
breakout will do (e.g. ESP12, HUZZAH) but may require slight adjustments to the
circuit.

Before you make a final decision about the board type read the chapter about
the [thermometer](#wifi-controller-thermometer) below.

### Case and Cables

Select a case that is IP64 or better to protect the circuit from moisture
and to protect the pool users from electrical shock. The same applies to the
cables and plugs. For my solution these components were the most expensive 
part of the project at around 30 EUR.

### Power Supply

This project will tap the 5 V DC power supplied by the SB-H20 mainboard to the
control panel. Using this power source avoids electrical hazards that may be
introduced by adding an additional mains power supply. A battery might be an
alternative, but with a typical power draw of 20 mA you need a rather large
power pack for a month of continuous operation.

The 20 mA apply if the ESP8266 is able to enter auto modem sleep mode and for
this the communication from and to the ESP8266 must be idle most of the time.
The periodic MQTT publish will interrupt this idle state only for a very short
time with a consumption at 70 mA. The power on current of the circuit is almost
100 mA and if you have a lot of WiFi traffic addressing the ESP8266, e.g.
broadcasts, the consumption might stay at 70 mA.

Beware that the power reserve of the SB-H20 mainboard is unknown and that's why
I added a fuse. It is still possible that the extra load of the WiFi controller
may overtax or damage the mainboard. With a consumption of 20 mA the probability
is rather low because a single segment of a 7-segment display alone will consume
a few mA and not all segments are on all the time but the power supply of the
SB-H20 should have the reserve for this case.

### Firmware

Build the firmware using the Arduino IDE with the board settings documented in the
INO file and flash the MCU. Note that the firmware uses DHCP and the MQTT server
is addressed by hostname. If you prefer static IPs you must modify the firmware
appropriately.

### Configuration

Edit the example configuration file *config.json* in the subdirectory *data*.
If you install the [Arduino ESP8266 LittleFS Filesystem Uploader](https://github.com/earlephilhower/arduino-esp8266littlefs-plugin)
you can use the *Tools* menu of the Arduino IDE to upload the content of the *data*
subdirectory to the MCU.

Example:

```json
{
 "wifiSSID":       "WiFi-SSID",
 "wifiPassphrase": "WiFi-secret",
 "mqttServer":     "mqtt.at.home",
 "firmwareURL":    "http://webserver.at.home/firmware/SB-H20-WiFiController.bin",
 "errorLanguage":  "EN"
}
```

If *firmwareURL* is undefined OTA updates are disabled. For *errorLanguage* you can
choose between "EN" and "DE". If *errorLanguage* is undefined, the control panel
error code will be used.

If you get a parsing error in the serial monitor when starting the MCU look closely
into your config file. Maybe you missed a quote or a comma somewhere.

### MQTT

Prepare your MQTT server for a new device.

**Subscribed Topics**

The *pool* topics are equivalent to the buttons on the control panel of the SB-H20.
Refer to the user manual for more details.

Wait for the next update of the equivalent published topic after each command and
use a timeout to detect command failure. The SB-H20 control panel can only handle
one command at a time. The duration for changing the water temperature depends on
the temperature delta.

If *wifi/state* is *error* you are only allowed to send the command *pool/command/power=off*.
The SB-H20 will continue to beep for a while. To clear the error it is necessary
to power down the SB-H20.

### WiFi Controller Thermometer

The circuit comes with a NTC sensor for measuring the temperature inside the
waterproof case. The ESP8266 is said to be rather robust (-40 Â°C to 125 Â°C)
but this way you are able to monitor the case temperature.

It cannot be avoided that the temperature inside a sealed case will be much
higher than the ambient temperature. For proper heat dissipation the metal
case of the ESP8266 could be attached to a heat spreader. But your options are
limited because you need a plastic case for good WiFi reception and electrical
isolation.

The default settings in the code provide an accuracy of approximately 1 Â°C
at room temperature and this should be good enough for most use cases.

If you need a higher accuracy you can calibrate the thermometer by providing the
following 4 values that should be measured with a mulitmeter with at least 3 digits
accuracy:

*ESP module not attached to circuit and not powered on:*
- Re: resistance between ESP module A0 and GND
- Rt: resistance between ESP8266 A0 and GND
- Rr: resistance between NTC and GND

*circuit powered on:*
- Vr: supply voltage at NTC

Insert these values into the thermometer setup command in the INO file:

```C++
 thermometer.setup(Rr, Vr, Rt/Re);
```

Some ESP modules do not come with a voltage divider for A0 (Re and Rt > 1 MOhm).
In this case you need to add your own voltage divider because the ESP8266 analog
input is limited to 1 V.

### Power On

Connect the WiFi controller to the SB-H20. Verify the pinout before
powering up the pool. After power up the control panel should operate
normally. The WiFi controller should connect to the AP, receive an IP address
and connect to the MQTT server within a few seconds. If this was successful it
will report the current status of the pool to the MQTT server.

### Troubleshooting

In case of an error you should check the logs of your AP and your MQTT server.
If the WiFi controller connects to the MQTT server successfully but reports
offline state you should check the pinout again, preferably with a scope.
If this does not help you should use the serial monitor of the Arduino IDE
and you can activate additional serial debugging in the firmware.

### Operation and Security

Security aspects are typically not the focus of a DIY project and the basics
for the electrical security have been mentioned above.

Regarding the network security of the project you will notice that it
does not include a webserver. At first glance this seems to reduce the
usability. But you need the Aruduino IDE anyway to build and upload the
firmware and uploading the config file with the Arduino IDE as a seconded
step is seamless. And if you want a webserver anyway it would be easy to add.

But not enabling the webserver is a security improvement because it is nearly
impossible to harden the webserver on an IoT device. That is why the project
only uses TCP/IP clients with predefined servers: One is the MQTT client and
the other is the OTA client. In this configuration a hacker must take over
significant parts of your network and if he got so far then he cannot be stopped
anyway if he knows what he is doing.

So just make sure that your MQTT server UI is secured properly and you will not
find your pool cover blown off because a guest turned on the bubbles while the
cover was closed.

One up would be to use encryption for the MQTT communication but the MQTT
client library currently does not support it.
